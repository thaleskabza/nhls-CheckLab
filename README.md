NHLS CheckLab is a digital inspection and compliance management platform designed to standardize and streamline the Waste Generator Site Inspection Checklist across all NHLS laboratories.
The system ensures consistent application of the NHLS Waste Management Policy and Procedures (GPS0061) and Healthcare Risk Waste Management (GPS0055) by enabling inspectors to assess, record, and report findings electronically.

The application features:

A client module for laboratories and inspectors to complete digital site inspections on mobile or desktop devices.

An admin module for NHLS environmental officers to configure checklists, manage users, and generate analytical or executive-level reports.

Built-in versioning, audit trails, and compliance statistics to maintain policy traceability and data integrity.

Secure PostgreSQL storage with JSON-based inspection records for flexible data analysis.

PDF and dashboard reporting to support both operational audits and executive oversight.

By digitizing waste inspection workflows, NHLS WasteCheck strengthens accountability, improves environmental compliance visibility, and reduces manual reporting effort across the national laboratory network.
